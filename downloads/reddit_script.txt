Narrator Opening: Welcome back to our channel! Today we are diving into a Reddit thread!

Narrator Intro: What is you experience with "boy moms"?

Scene Transition: Comments Pop Up


unicorns3373: One of my coworkers is a “boy mom” she has one son and 2 daughters and the only time she talks about her daughters is when she’s insulting them and calling them “little bitches” and lazy. Her son is the center of her and and husband’s world. He is  a junior, named after her husband and she openly talks about how he is her husband’s favorite and how spoiled he is. She will talk about buying her son a couple hundred dollar pair of shoes and stuff for school shopping and making her daughters buy their own. 

She talks about how “high maintenance” girls are and how her son is so easy. 

She makes her daughters do chores and not her son because he “doesn’t do it right”. 

I could go on and on.

She is literally the worst!

>> quiksylver296: That's so sad.  I can't believe people are truly like that.

>> Kimono-Ash-Armor: Those poor daughters. I hope they leave the abusive home and never look back. The best elder care statistically comes from conscientious daughters, and those golden mama’s boys are usually too spoiled to be good caretakers, plus the boy moms won’t want to bother their golden sons anyway.

>> ThunderbunsAreGo: It’s the golden boys wife who will inevitably be bullied into caring for mother dearest in her old age, while having to endure the old bat telling her how her son could’ve married someone better/prettier/smarter/etc

>> Lissy_Wolfe: Never. If your partner doesn't stand up for you against someone like this (even when it's a close relative), then it's not worth staying with them. I would never stay with someone who bullied me into anything, much less expected me to sacrifice my life for someone who treats me like shit. No one deserves that.

>> woodlynd831: I think my mom resonates with being a boy mom more than anything else even though she has one of each of us 🤣. I feel this. I’m always lazy no matter what apparently!! Even though I worked my way through my college education and am going back in my thirties for an advanced degree. Meanwhile, my brother had his finances and loans managed by mommy 🙄. It wouldn’t be eye rolling if the differences weren’t so blatant lol. I could’ve certainly used help as I had no idea what I was doing and am the older sibling!!

>> IllustriousLadyBug: This is what really gets to me - how askew some people's image of girl vs boy is. It's a great deservice these moms do to their sons. They enable bad habits, lack of accountability, maintaining low to zero awareness, etc and are surprised every time they hear something that resembles a growing up opportunity happening to their child. Sometimes I think boy moms really want their boys to be Peter Pan

>> unicorns3373: I’m so glad my parents had all girls because they would totally be “boy parents” otherwise.

>> noisemonsters: Oml she is raising an absolute terror of a man to be. An honest menace. This is so frustrating to hear.

>> EquippedThought: Being starved of love and treated as burdens surely isn’t devastating when your brother is worshipped as a demigod. Hopefully, he directs some harsh words at their parents to protect his sisters. You’d think someone close enough would share some strong thoughts on loving and validating their daughters existence. The parents need to be directly called out. Some family therapy would be a good start.

Forsaken_Composer_60: Oh man. I dated the son of one of those boy moms. He was her precious baby boy even after giving me a black eye. "You must have done something horrible for him to do that to you." Yeah, you can have him back.

>> luvrg1rll: Bruh sameeee omg it’s insane how deluded they are!!!

>> ChloeThF: I have almost literally the same story. Had a bf who's mom had three boys. It was definitely something I did according to her, when he pushed me several times and tried to get a chokehold on me. Happy I left that loser after the first time he was physical with me although I should have left sooner. Sorry you had to go through that, it's so tough.

I hope you feel better today. You said "my mum *was* one, so I suppose you are not in contact with her? If you feel better, that is for the best honestly.
I also had a very complicated relationship with my parents, especially my now dead mother who was annoyed by my existence and always would say that she lost her youth because of me, and that I should be grateful that she did not abort laalala
.. complicated. 
But we are not our parents/family in a way that we capable to liberate ourselves from all that transgenerational trauma..

curryp4n: Terrible. I dated one of the boys of a “boy mom.” Basically her 2 sons could do no wrong. For example, my ex would constantly borrow money. Conservatively $5k in the 2 years we dated. Which was a lot for me at the time. When we ended things, I asked for him to pay me back. He didn’t so I took him to small claims court. He brought his mom to yell at me. She said her precious baby would never borrow from me… I had everything recorded on Venmo LOL. She was legit speechless for a few minutes until she said why was paying for dates a big deal? I said not only did I pay for our outings, he borrowed money from me outside of that. His brother too. Anyway she said I shouldn’t be doing this. It’s not womanly.. whatever that means 🙄

>> Tr1pp_: Hahhaha im sorry that is hilarious. When you run out of any reasonable arguments accuse the other party of being unwomanly/unmanly regardless of the situation 😅

>> curryp4n: Exactly. This was just 1 of many things I had to endure from her. She was absolutely a ridiculous woman

>> coaxialology: So according to her logic, borrowing money from your girlfriend, and not repaying her, is manly?

>> EquippedThought: Only for her sons, because they’re perpetual victims of ungodly women. But any other man is scum who would do such a thing.

>> blonderaider21: It’s just stealing at that point!

>> BBQsandw1ch: Lmao it's not very manly to welch on your debts either but here we are. 

>> eemox: Or to bring mommy in to yell and get you out of the trouble you made for yourself!

>> missdespair: It's womanly to get scammed, didn't you know??? /s

They're setting them up to fail in life but they aren't my kids

NauticalNoire: Internalized misogyny through the roof.


Always believe their sons could do no wrong.


Failure to take any accountability.


Usually they have a strange relationship with their son(s) where "no other woman is as good for him as his mother". 🤢

They tend to believe "boys are easier to raise than girls" because they don't teach their sons how to take care of themselves and be decent human beings.

>> SherbertPlenty1768: The last part is kind of an oxymoron in this context? It is said boys are easier to raise because they don't require much emotional attention, but It also makes them emotionally detached. Boy moms would clean up after every mess while leave their daughters alone or berate them. I'd imagine it is hard to do, but she loves to do that.  And raising spolied brats at it. 

Not too different from Father's princess vibes I think. Fulfilling every demand and being there for literally every minor inconvenience in their lives, how is she going to take care of herself when you're gone? 

In both cases, why would anyone marry an overgrown child? Consciously anyway. 

>"no other woman is as good for him as his mother"

"No woman is going to love him like a mother does". It is true, there is no doubt about it. What you mentioned is really a twisted/unhealthy version of that.

evancalous: People who use that as a cornerstone of their identity have some internalized misogyny they need to deal with.

>> somethingreddity: Agreed. I have 2 boys (almost 2 and almost 1) and “boy moms” make me cringe. 😖 my MIL gave me a “boy mom” shirt and I only wear it to bed or to the gym lol. It does not see the light of day other than that. I know she doesn’t know the connotation though. She’s just also a mom of 2 boys. She’s not a “boy mom” though.

>> evancalous: My MIL bought me some "dog mom"  merch and I feel the same way about it. Not as bad of connotations but still.

>> St_Charlatan: Absolutely. In a FB comment, a 'boy mom' was greeting another woman on her son's birthday, emphasizing that only boys' moms realize 'the great blessing to have a son' and I said 'Come on, this is an insult to your mom!'

>> openenvelopen: Why hasn’t this been upvoted more?!?!

judithpoint: My sister is the worst kind. My nephew is not even 2 and she’s already talking about all the “hoes and bitches” that are going to try to trap him with a pregnancy? Projection is not just a therapy buzz word…. 

She’s also OBSESSED with the fact that he is biracial (we are white, his father is Dominican and Cape Verdean). I do think his cultural identity is super important, but it feels like tokenism to me. Literally someone commenting on his curly hair and she’s like “well he is ****BIRACIAL****!” So cringey. But I’m white, so what do I know?

>> nicolew1026: That makes it feel so fetishized and weird lmao. I’d probably respond with “Oh okay, did you know I went to Disneyland when I was a kid with my parents?” “Just thought we were telling random facts… 

On the alternate side, (I also am white female), I had a roommate (dark skinned Jamaican female) we were best friends so she often would take or pick up my son from school, either with me or alone and the looks we’d get sometimes were WILD. Like yeah, he’s my kid, he’s blonde and blue eyed, yeah this is my friend, she helps me with him, where’s the confusion? Why are you astounded by this? 😂😂

Thatzwutshesaid99: I married a boy whose mom idolized him and shoved his sister to the side. 

Throughout our marriage she chipped away at me, made him choose sides, even told some nice lies about me. All in the interest of pushing me out.

Well, she won.

>> crabbydotca: Sounds like /r/justnoMIL material

LilMamiDaisy420: My ex’s mom had his back even after he would violently beat me. I told his dad what was going on and got that lady in trouble.

>> luvrg1rll: It’s weird how the dads always usually have more common sense than the boy moms

>> strangeraround: It is the same behavior mothers exhibit with their daughters. 

>> LilMamiDaisy420: Idk…. I have an aunt that is obsessed with her sons. But, with her daughter… she’s always calling her names and putting her down. I think women can sometimes struggle with Envy more than they’d like to admit… and women are often times jealous asf of their daughters… so idk

>> strangeraround: My aunt is the same woman. She has two sons and she is hella obsessed with them. She sees no wrong with her sons which get to the point of irritation because her sons are just horrible people.

Plus the woman part there is something that I have noticed with my mother as well. My mom is normal loving woman, but at times she doesn't like me taking all the attention. Meaning if there is an argument between my mother and I and for a very rare once in a lifetime my father picks up my side, she will bash me and belittle me and be super mean about it. I think my father realises and he never picks my side and keeps quiet. I don't have a very amicable relationship with my father and a very validation seeking relationship with my mother. So yes women are like that.

ChocolateBaconBeer: When someone uses the label, I roll my eyes. It gives strong not like the other girls 💅 energy.

>> margheritinka: Yes! My cousin who’s in her 50s (her bod is amazing) has two teenage boys and it’s definitely like a part of her superiority complex that she produced boys. And her kids are strong and she’s always taking them to weight lift or they’re always welding or like using bows and arrows and shit in the woods, her one 13 yo legit looks like a man. That feeds her ego but she also sexualizes the older one somewhat. Posting pics that any parent would post on social media but then will comment “look at that man” about her over developed son.

>> cleansetheseregrets: See, what’s funny is—I am a mother of three sons. Saying you are a boy mom, at least in my little corner of the earth, essentially means—hey, no drama here. 

My best friend has boy/girl twins and she reports regularly that the girl moms (not necessarily the actual girls) are setting up play dates so their daughters can make the “right” friends, intervening and manipulating “friendships” so their own daughters stand out as superior. I’ve never set up a play date and let my sons figure social stuff out on their own unless they ask me for advice. Even then, I try to make things as simple as possible so it doesn’t introduce drama into a friend group dynamic. 

I love the “not like other girls” subreddit but I have to say I don’t see myself as part of that. I love having sons and the simplicity of boys. That being said, my sons are well aware of boundaries I find not acceptable, like talking about girls in terms of their physical appearance and letting “boys be boys.” 

I’m sorry you find yourself surrounded my boy moms who think their sons can do no wrong. I always assume my sons are in the wrong unless proven otherwise. Because a lot of boys (2 of my 3) like to exhibit behavior that drives their teachers crazy, I am frequently siding with their teacher.  And they are often in the wrong. 

I’m not raising perfect angel boys but they are good kids who make mistakes and can admit to them freely. Better than raising a manipulative kid who can Eddie Haskell his way out of trouble. And a lot of my mom friends with boys feel exactly as I do. 

Reading these responses like HOLY SHIT y’all need new friends. I don’t know anyone like you’re describing in real life. But I also don’t know anyone who hangs their identity on having a specific sex offspring. That’s weird. 

Mothers who have their own identities are cool. Having the identity of your kid or even your kid’s protector is really, really sad and truly pathetic.

>> Tough_Music4296: >My best friend has boy/girl twins and she reports regularly that the girl moms (not necessarily the actual girls) are setting up play dates so their daughters can make the “right” friends, intervening and manipulating “friendships” so their own daughters stand out as superior.

I don't have a daughter, and in this moment I'm pretty relieved. I wouldn't know how to play that game. I've also never set up a play date. 

Who are the "right" friends when you're a 7 year old girl? The kid with the best variety of Barbies?

alliejc: My favorite “boy mom” was my MIL. She raised my husband and his brother with boundaries, they know how to sew, cook and all about the menstrual cycle. She knew they might have women in their lives one day and needed to be prepared to support. They’re sensitive and not afraid to show emotion. She only let them sit to pee in her house so no cleaning up dribbles or falling in the toliet. 

After I had my first child she pulled me aside and made sure he was doing his part. Told me to let her know if he wasn’t and she’d talk to him. I miss that wonderful woman so much.

Large_Camera8068: Overly protective, jealous, and blind to any of their son’s wrongdoings. My grandma on my father’s side would be fake nice to me while my father was around, as soon as he was gone, she would insult me and try to belittle me. One of my aunts of two boys would always get between any of their romantic relationships or girls they had over. If either one got themselves into a bad situation, my aunt would gaslight their friends into them believing it was their fault and that her sons had no part of it. My ex’s mother who I had actually become pretty close with at the time– her son had cheated on me, she tried to gaslight me into saying that it wasn’t cheating and that I should stay.

>> wave_the_wheat: What the fuck

cloverthewonderkitty: I used to work in childcare and education, and my experience has been there are Moms and then there are the Crazy Moms, regardless of their "brand" (tiger/boy/almond/free range/etc).

I worked for a woman who was the mother of 3 boys, 2 were twins, and the eldest was only 18 mos older than the twins. She was normal and chill. She did lots of "boy stuff" so was fine with the title "boy mom".

Before that I worked for a lady who was just absolutely bananas. Her sons opening line was, "this might be weird, but I was breastfed until I was six. I just like to let people know." That poor kid. Like, he knew there was something off, but didn't have enough experience outside of his home to fully understand the levels of crazy he was subjected to on a daily basis. The woman also had a daughter, so she wasn't just a "boy mom" but dear God do I feel for her son's future partners.

>> Elisa_LaViudaNegra: Breastfed until SIX? I bet he wanted to stop a lot sooner than six. Poor kid.

>> Probs-in-the-toilet: Wasn’t that a very normal age until relatively recently? I remember my Biology teacher telling us how our grandparents/great grandparents were probably breastfed until the age of 8 because vaccines were not that common and breast milk gave the child alpha antibodies AND while the mother was breastfeeding she wasn’t getting her period so it was a natural contraceptive.

>> DreamingDragonSoul: Breastfeeding decrease fertility, but doesn't eliminate it. And yes, they used to breastfeed longer back when, but I don't know for how long. Mayby to the next one arrived.

>> Probs-in-the-toilet: Well, yes, I should have said it’s not an effective method 😂😂

fbidirectorcuomeyyy: I was married to the youngest son of a “boy mom” for 5 years. She was the biggest issue in our marriage. She would always talk about me while I was in the room and refer to me as “she”. I got really sick of asking for basic respect and my husband made me feel crazy. I am newly divorced and have never been happier. Whenever I see old pictures that’s she’s in, I could cry tears of happiness that I never have to see this awful woman again. 

Side story re this “boy mom”: we had a shared album with my husband, his brother, brothers wife, MIL and FIL. My MIL would take beauty cam selfies and post them in the shared album. She didn’t realize that the beauty cam watermark was at the bottom of each picture. I told my friends one day and they thought it was the weirdest thing ever that she was posting these fake beautified selfies in an album with just her sons, husband and DILS. Also like we didn’t all know what she actually looked like….. so odd.

enym: My mil has only boys. Shortly after we got married she posted an article from a mom blogger about how having boys can be hard because "you'll never get to be the one to choose the wedding venue" (and other language about how evil daughters in law steal their sons from them) but that there's nothing like the bond between a mom and her son 🙄

She's also made comments to me that she's glad my BILs wife is Jewish because it means she gets BIL for the holidays, and at my BILs wedding (her second son to get married) she made a comment about how it's hard to not be "queen" any more. 

I remember when I was pregnant she asked how I was feeling and I her how sick I've been and she said "I wish I could say I'm sorry to hear that but I'm not," referring to the belief that means baby is growing healthily. 

Our relationship spans over a decade and while she's generally been nice to me, these moments do stand out and I've never been super comfortable with her nor do I personally like her. I don't get in the way of my kids or husband having a relationship with her but I don't text her, connect with her on socials, hug her hello/goodbye, etc.

>> scarlettskadi: The wedding venue? Really? 
FFS😆
My son got married this year and I couldn’t have cared less about the venue.
I know we usually take a backseat to the bride’s mother but it ain’t about us- just the happiness of our kids.

>> enym: Right? I was like, my mom didn't choose the venue either?

>> scarlettskadi: Yes… some take things a bit too personally.
His wife’s mother and I have an unspoken understanding and don’t harsh each other’s buzz.

Electric_Minx: My MIL is textbook "boy mom". I got permission to shut that shit down real quick when we met because even he thinks it's weird. 

What makes it worse is he's the ONLY CHILD. Took a couple of years, but through r/JNMIL, I'd found words to put her in her place. 

Went along the lines of, "if you want to marry your son, just say that." 

And "he's your son, not your boyfriend."

"Nobody can love him like I do!" She says in a drunken state one time while she was in town.

I replied, "clearly you haven't loved him enough, because I'm still fucking raising him." 

I wouldn't doubt if she was the catalyst behind several relationships ending with how she behaves. She's backed off a bit, but I know that lunatic resents me just for being his wife, or in her eyes, "the other woman".

>> None: This is great, but I hope he's standing up to her on his own as well.

>> Electric_Minx: He isn't. He just lets her do her own thing. But the look he shot her after said it all. He knew I was right, and I think she got the point. They haven't been back since having my nephew to test the theory.

>> None: Oh no, he needs to be speaking up on his own. Otherwise, he's enabling her. You two are supposed to be a team. Otherwise, you're just being flung to the wolves by your own husband.

>> Electric_Minx: I reminded him of just that and he finally did. I said to him, "if you have ANY respect for me as YOUR WIFE, YOU should be speaking, not me. She's your mama, not mine."

He's socially ignorant so often times, it takes me verbally smacking him with reality before he gets it. Had to tell him that I'm capable of standing my ground with anyone, I just shouldn't be expected to when it comes to HIS family.

>> Electric_Minx: He is now that I explained that standing up for myself, in this instance is completely uncalled for.

Idontknowflycasual: I've explained to many many people that there is a huge difference between a mother of boys and a ✨boy mom✨.

catshark2o9: I'm a "boy mom" but mine is 23. He's learned to clean up after himself, cook, wash, vacuum, fold clothes etc. I come from a traditional Mexican family where it is unheard of for a boy to do these things, but I taught him anyway. I refuse to have an useless manchild.

Affectionate_Law1287: I’m a mom of boys— tween and teen.  I wish there was some label that said “hey, I’m doing my level best and trying hard here to raise really good young men …and I welcome the village’s support and also I apologize in advance bc we aren’t yet where we need to be.” 

There is nothing “better” about being a mom of boys but in my case, it definitely feels like it’s own thing.  Being part of a girls-only family growing up —it’s been eye opening!

>> ChocolateBaconBeer: How does it feel like its own thing to you? Just curious!

>> Sinaenuna: I've said some stuff I NEVER imagined having to say as a co-parent. ("Stop licking the car and go to school!"  "Stop BITING your TOENAILS! OH MY GOD."  "Nope, give me the stick. Now, beat each other up like NORMAL siblings. With hands ONLY." *cue fighting sounds, followed by GIGGLING* [Mind you, they were both sobbing and screaming at each other not 30 seconds prior.])


However, ONLY with the boy have I ever had to whip out a paperclip, do the 'metal fatigue example' then point to his pants and say: 'Dude, same concept.' to get him to let go of his damned junk. (PRETTY sure he knows I was lying by now, but it's still working for the most part, so idk.)

ONLY with the boy have I ever had to utter the phrase: "No, I don't know why your toy car doesn't have a penis."

As well as things like: "No, we don't take the ENTIRE TOILET PAPER ROLL off the wall and use it to clean up our spray then PUT IT BACK."  And  "No, boxer-brief are NOT pants, thus you CANNOT wear just that to school."  And  "No, you CANNOT chop down the (fully-grown, 50ft) tree over there to make a sand pit, tf."


His room is horrifying, and he speaks in Fortnite.


Mind you, he's only 9 at this point.

>> Freespirit7979: I relate to you so much! "Don't lick the cat." "That is not something we do in the living room" and my absolute fav was one of my boys tried putting his wee wee in a tic tac box when he was 3! Why? My boys are now 20, 17 and 14. Raising them has been an adventure for sure! My poor daughter whom is 22 now learned and taught them so much as well. Hang in there! Parenting in general is not for the weak!

>> Kerfluffle2x4: Dude, that’s why the only “boy mother” accurately reflected on tv was the mom from Malcolm in the Middle. It doesn’t be like that.

>> Tommy_Riordan: Yeah. All of this is what I mean when I call myself a boy mom.  “Guys, no yelling PENIS when I’m on the phone, please.”  “Yes, you have to change your underwear daily. No, this is not a brand new concept I’m springing on you as a surprise before school today.”  “For god’s sake please put on deodorant.”  “I need you to hang up your axe and swords before grandma comes over.”  “Trees aren’t for peeing on.”  “Get OFF the refrigerator!”  All things I have never had to say to a lady child.

>> CourageDearHeart-: “No shooting trebuchets at your brother.”

“No, we aren’t going to this water to pee in (the Atlantic Ocean, The Delaware River, etc.) “No, I don’t know if George Washington peed in the Delaware when they crossed it.” 

“No, you can’t wear swimming trunks and your dad’s ratty old T-shirt to a wedding.”

“No, they aren’t called the gas giants because they are farty. Although I do think there is a lot of methane…hm.”

“Don’t drink creek water and if you spit it out like a fountain, that’s still ‘drinking’ even if you don’t swallow.” 

“Ok, when you are aiming in the potty. Try and sink the Cheerio. Sink it!!!”

“Candy corn isn’t a vegetable.” 

“I don’t know how to say ‘fart’ in Latin. It’s not in the your book. I’ll Google it…. In an incognito tab.”

>> cleansetheseregrets: My 16 year old son knows Latin for fart.

>> PristinePrinciple752: Lol the boxer thing reminds me of when we were in kindergarten and a kid thought he had shorts on under his pants. Next thing we know he was on the monkey bars in his Rugrats boxers no matter how many times us other kids told him there is no way his mom sent him to school with shorts under his pants. Can't remember the kids face but I remember the Rugrats boxers 26 years later.

>> Dance-Magic-Dance72: Haha, mine are

"Please take a shower, you smell like chicken soup"
"Please stop leaving floaters in the toilet and flush it"
"Please clean your pee off the seat so I don't keep sitting in it" "Please clean your pee off the floor so I don't keep stepping in it" "no you can't scream the words penis and balls everywhere we go" "dude, clip those talons before you tear your sheets apart" "yes you have to put on deodorant"
"Get your hand out of your pants and stop playing with yourself"

My two main favorites were

"Stop looking up YouTube porn on your brothers school laptop" 

"No, you can't wear your poop stained underwear inside out to get another day out of it."

"Yes, I can see the fish is dead. No, we don't need to poke its eyeball with a stick to find out if it's still alive"

Or when my oldest son came home from the Marine Corp and my youngest told him about the hot girl who works at tractor supply being perfect for him and having my oldest respond "dude, I'm not going to bring home a girl while I live at home with my mom and share a room with my little brother and say "don't mind him baby let's bang" " 🤣

ThrowRAanongirly7: My ex was his mums only son (3 daughters, 1 son), he could do NO wrong. She was never my biggest fan.. but when he cheated on me and I called off our engagement, she told ME off for calling off the engagement saying that everyone has hiccups when they get engaged and it should be excused and the engagement continue (it did not). 

Then when he cheated AGAIN several more times over the space of a year, I did finally get the balls to break up with him… she asked me what I did wrong to make him cheat🥹

alexlp: My SIL is becoming one. She kinda hates being a mum too though so I think she’s just trying to find something that makes it make sense and be fun.

None: My experance with boy mums is they don't teach their sons to adult. 

My ex at 26!!! Was woken up by mum, had his bed changed by mum, was cooked and served for by ..... can you guess......yep mum!!

She created a man child. She was pleasant to my face but I strongly suspected she didn't like me at first. I think I grew on her as I encouraged him to do more for himself. He moved out. She had a melt down. 

I kicked him out a year later and she had another melt down. I think she had gotten used to the idea that her son had grown up and then I dumped him back on her. 

My now husbands mother is amazing!

>> CrytalBell: That sounds close to my ex’s mom. He was basically a husband to her. It was an awful 10 months.

TheCharlieIsAGamer: I’ve only ever seen the ones who are a bit too close like “I’m my sons only love” and they then hate the girlfriends

FemmeCatalyst: There is a difference between a woman being a mom of boys, and a self proclaimed “Boy mom”.

My experience with self proclaimed boy moms is they have some level of internalized misogyny either due to an inflated ego, and/or a core wound they are trying to heal through manipulating and controlling their mother-son dynamic. 

Sadly the result ends up being adult men who are codependent. Which is why in the majority of heterosexual marriages, the woman ends up putting in more mental and emotional labor. These are also the kinds of dynamic that leads to triangulation, where a mother in law does not respect boundaries of their sons marriage.

>> MrsCrowbar: Thank you. I am a mum of boys, and I don't call myself a "boy mum", other people always comment "oh, all boys! A boy Mum!" 
Now, I assume that they mean all of the bad things people are writing on here. BUT I'm just a Mum!! It makes no difference what the gender of my children is. I am raising them as best I can with the aim that they will be great adults who will treat others as they wish to be treated. I look forward to meeting future girls (or boys if that's the case) and welcoming them to our family. Any parent, of any gender, that gets involved in their adult children's relationships without being asked is just a parent with weird attachment.

TerraNikata: I’m convinced I was the dating the son of the queen of boy moms. He was her step-son but that whole relationship in hindsight raised some red flags. 

She had 3 kids of her own, 2 boys and 1 girl who was the oldest. She treated her daughter like dirt and was always picking fights with her. The boys could do no wrong, they had no curfews or anything. 


Her relationship with my ex was INSANE. Like, I found out later they slept in the same bed and everything. When she found out he was verbally abusive to me, she ranted about how “lucky” I was that he never put hands on me. She also slapped me when I had enough and screamed back at him in front of her. That woman was insane.

>> Bruh_columbine: Ooooh the way I would have tussled my MIL… I was never put to that point of actually doing it but I’ve been so close. The last time was probably when she stole from our child to cover her drug debts 🫠🥴

>> TerraNikata: Holy fuck!

Yeah, her oldest literally got married to get away from her. Madness. If she ever tries to speak to me I might consider it tbh

I’m so sorry your MIL did that.

missdovahkiin1: My only experience is that some of them were really nasty about my daughter, mostly in the infant stage. "Good luck with having a nasty teenager." Sneers and "SO glad I don't have deal with periods." I think it was less misogyny, although obviously that plays a factor, but more jealously. Every one of these women kept trying to have a girl and it didn't work out and so they were bitter about it and this was their way of coping. Still not convinced if they actually wanted a daughter or a doll to dress up and call their mini me.

Lillllammamamma: This is a similar conversation that’s going on in a parenting subreddit right now, so I’ll share my same comment here.

I am a mom of three girls and at a friends baby shower  about 4 years ago (right before the world shut down) this conversation was happening, as the mom to be was keeping it a surprise at birth. When I shared that my own experience with girls wasn’t much different than those shared by boy parents, minus the penis specific items (my girls love sports, video games, rough housing, legos, super hero’s, speed demons; rocks in pockets and book bags, the outdoors, etc) , there were 2 boy moms who I swear you’d think I had called their mother a hamster. They went OFF. How dare I compare such different and unique experiences? Apparently I said my experiences from a place of superiority? Oh.. and when my girls became teens and were “cackling harpies” I’d see how wrong I was and “good luck” to me then, because “everyone knows teenager girls are terrible and end up hating their moms”.

Sooo ya? Idk… my kids are 10, 14 and 16 and there’s been no switch flipped where they suddenly hate me. Rocks are still very much a thing though, but it’s my own fault now that the eldest has her own rock tumblers, she will borrow other family members pockets to bring them home when hers exceeds capacity.

lucid_sunday: The ones whos entire personality is “boy mom”? Emotionally incestuous.

crazybear13: I have a cousin who's a "boy Mom" and I'm a mom to a boy and girl. She has said some things that are a little messed up about little girls. She has also said she would never want to be a mom to a girl. 
Uh, sorry, but you have no Idea what you are missing. My girl is the most loving, warm and wonderful little creature and it's so weird that people hate her because of her gender.
Girls are just as awesome as boys and I do not understand the girl hate from these moms. 
Also, I am told that "boys are just different, I wouldn't understand." I have a boy too! And gender is a weird thing to get hung up on. My boy loves playing with an Elsa Barbie doll and lightsabers. My girl loves her baby dolls and roaring at everything like a dinosaur. So I find the gender flex to be very strange since it feels like a societal attribute as opposed to a biological divide.

birdsofwar1: I dated the son of a “boy mom”. It was wild. There were 2 sons, 1 daughter. Tbh both sons were bums. No drive, virtually no ambition, and both completely living off of their parents. The sister worked her butt off playing soccer in college and became a veterinarian. When I was dating the youngest son, he was 25/26, the oldest brother was 30. They lived in a disgusting house their parents bought for them. They had basically no expenses. They could do no wrong. They had money and resources thrown at them and their terrible behavior was always enabled by her. 

When my ex cheated on me with his intern, his mom was all for it. He “deserved to be taken care of”. He, and his mother, both expected that he be in a relationship where he was waited on hand and foot. The new girl was ready to be barefoot in the kitchen. I was tired of buying him groceries that he would let rot. I was out, she was in. Thank god

Sp1d3rb0t: I think it's really weird when someone thinks boys and girls should be raised differently.

lakelilypad: My mother in law had all sons, she great though. Her top priority was raising her children to be respectful and responsible adults. 

Also, she freaking loves me. I get to all the girly things with her. It’s nice.

mistymountainhop22: THOSE types of boy moms are the absolute worst. So much internalized misogyny. I wouldn’t give that negative energy any type of day. 

However I wouldn’t be so quick to assume that someone calling themself a boy mom is inherently toxic. Growing up I had a lot of issues with men/boys that damaged my relationship with the opposite gender. I swore to never have children and if I did they would HAVE to be girls. I was blessed with a step son and baby boy. I’m now proud to be a “boy mom” and it’s helped me heal the cycle of gender resentment. I never thought I could be a good mother to a boy and I am so proud I am.

>> ThatEmoNumbersNerd: I have a son and having him definitely helped me heal my gender resentment as well. It forced me to learn about what boys / men go through by other men / boys. Which I think is helping me raise a gentleman? Or at least I hope so anyways lol but having him definitely helped me view men in a different light.

>> mistymountainhop22: Same here. I thought for sure I’d have a girl in order to protect her but I think it’s fitting I have boys so I can let go of my resentment. 

I am so glad that you are having this healing experience as well. Your son is lucky to have you as a mom ❤️

>> ThatEmoNumbersNerd: We have boys so we can raise them to be safe men ♥️ that’s how we protect our girls! 

Your son is lucky too. We’re paving the way for a new generation of men.

>> mistymountainhop22: I love this 😭❤️😭

>> Zealousideal_Bus7335: hey wanted to say I feel you, I grew up in a really toxic home and worried (still worry) that I wouldn't be a good mum to boys, I have 2 and love the bones off them but have to be careful not to be too hard on them. Generational trauma is a pain. I can't stand the aduly men in my life and their weaponised incompetence, hopefully can do a better job with my boys in a loving way

>> mistymountainhop22: My heart goes out to you. You can do this, mama. You are doing this ❤️

Aquatic_Bunnie: Boy moms are fine until they self label as Boy Mom, and then for whatever reason they become insufferable misogynists

FaithlessnessWeak800: My husband’s first cousin’s wife is 40 with 3 toddler boys and that is ALL her social media is. Hashtag everything about being a boy mom. I have 4 kids (toddlers/babies) 2 girl and 2 boy but i am not in your face about my kids unless asked, and no I do not have social media to annoy people with it either.

Chloe_182: Really good, actually.

My MIL is a mother to three boys and she's lovely, amazing and supportive.

searedscallops: Anyone who identifies as a boy mom is super annoying. Like, develop interests and a personality outside of motherhood.

Ashley4645: I'm a boy mom to 4 boys. I think it's important to teach them the same way you would teach a daughter. Good work ethic, respect, how to maintain their homes, cooking, and so on. I find it difficult to keep them physically safe because boys can do stupid things sometimes. Accountability is a major thing I've had to teach especially with older boys. 

Their father comes from an all-boy mom as well. They were taught to do chores and work hard as well; however, she was very dismissive of their lack of respect and bad treatment to women.  Once they married, she would say "He's yours now". Eventually I responded, "You need to raise him again, the first time didn't work, take him back".  I also noticed no one they've ever been with was good enough. She would always talk bad about them as if her sons deserved to be kings of the world.  Sure, all parents feel this way about their children, but good parents hold their children accountable where needed.

>> BxGyrl416: Please tell me you’re no longer with this man

the_shy_one1: I think the ones who make "boy mom" their identity are slightly disappointed they don't have a daughter and overcompensate by claiming they're sooo happy they never had a girl because "boys are more fun, love their mama, and are so much easier than girls."

DisciplineProud7102: I love my boyfriends mom But yeah she is definitely the typical boy mom. She drove me a bit nuts at first lol told me I won the lottery by being with her son like okay ma’am.  She has other sons too which is weird because I don’t see her talk to them like that either. And the relationship with her daughter isn’t great either.
Soo who knows. But she is a sweet lady and has a big heart.

newfckup: I'm a boy mom. My son is 2 years old.
I am teaching him to volunteer to do dishes. If he pees on the floor he cleans. I dont want him to be as the boys I dated and I dont want to be_that_ MIL.

Select_Ambition_628: Technically not my experience, but years ago one of my classmates said she was irritated because she had a little boy playing at her house with her child , & when it was time to clean up the toys he said “my mommy says cleaning up isn’t for little boys.”  & when she laughingly told his mom what he had said , the mother was adamant about how her precious son was not going to be cleaning up.

_paramour: Horrific. One of my ex boyfriend’s mums absolutely worshipped him to a point of creepiness. I had a close relationship with her while we dated and she would actively cover for him when he lied and cheated on me. It was an absolute mindfuck when even your partner’s mum joins in on gaslighting and manipulating you.

lilacsforcharlie: Never had an experience thank the lord. Most of my family’s children are girls and of the few men I dated seriously, even some being mamas boys, never like what I see on TikTok and Reddit. It terrifies me. Then I had my son. I know the difference between loving my son and wanting to be the only woman to love my son. Fucking whack jobs all of them and I hope I stay lucky enough that these “boy moms” stay in the internet lol. I don’t think I’d be able to keep my mouth shut. I wonder what would happen if one were told like, “It sounds like you want to fuck your son, or maybe that you’d like your son to want to fuck you… why is that?” lol that’s all it screams to me. Is just weird, incestuous jealousy of these poor girls who more times than not don’t even exist in these boys lives yet! Or like if I had a friend or family member post some creepy ass shit like “keep your Barbie Hussey away from my sweet sweet son” and it’s a post about toddlers… I stg I’d cut someone out if they behaved that way lol. Like how are you gonna show your fucking weird ass colors than come after my daughter in the same breath?! Fucking crazy assholes.

Leather_Magazine_449: When we talked about the move in things (in Covid, I only found work in their area) she said to me (after she said okay to this) “I think you two are too young and you should try out other people.” I was frozen. She just said yes, so I can move to them for a couple of months, and said THIS? A few days after that ofc we broke up bc of his idiot mom.. (we were together for 2 years and basically I spent the most of the time in their house, but always wanted buying myself groceries etc… but most of the time they won’t let me, they wanted to pay it for me.. idk what was going on behind my back..)

1v1menoob: My ex’s mom ruined our relationship. She was in the middle of our argument before we broke up and forced us to take a break. After a few days of thinking, I thought it best to cut things off and really give it time for us to be apart, so I went to break up with him. She opened the door, told me no, and slammed the door in my face.

sarilysims: Depends. Are we talking about a mom who has all boys, or a mom who makes having all boys her entire personality? Because the first is fine, the latter is annoying and super creepy.

eratoast: My ex-MIL is a Boy Mom. He worshipped her and they had a super weird relationship. She almost died during childbirth and had to have an emergency hysterectomy and spent his ENTIRE LIFE telling him that it was his fault, he "almost killed \[her\]," and that she couldn't have a girl like she wanted (and then turned that into saying how "all girls are brats, you don't want a daughter, they're terrible"). He was at her beckon call 24/7 to the detriment of our relationship and apartment, and I was never going to be as important to him as she was.

Adorable_Seat_5648: My friend is not a self proclaimed “boy mom” but she most certainly falls into this category. 

Her son is 4 and has a history of biting, both adults and other kids. She always explains it that he has too many emotions and *because he is a boy* he doesn’t know how to express them without biting. Any time he would rough play with other kids and he got out of hand, she would explain that “boys will be boys”. No teaching or scolding or apologising to other parents. Honestly, I feel so sorry for her son’s future partner! 

She also has a younger daughter who behaves similarly. But she will talk to her daughter about her behaviour and tries to teach her not to bite or hit or fight. She can parent! But because her eldest is a boy, she excuses his behaviour completely and doesn’t parent him at all.

Of course, when my daughters (similar age) act out, she is the first one to ask me “what is wrong with your kids!” 🤣

>> amphetamine709: IDK how you guys can stay friends TBH. I hope your poor daughters don’t get forced into playdates with him. He’ll act out and lash out and they’ll be forced by her to take the blame.

gardenvarietyhater: My mother in law. 3 boys. She is awesome. She seems like she has always wanted girls and is super cool with all her daughters in law. She goes above and beyond getting us gifts, figuring out what we like etc.

stonerbaby112: Every “boy mom” I’ve ever met has said “Boys will be boys” in response to any bad behavior. Because of that, anyone who says “I’m a “boy mom” “ instantly loses a bit of respect from me and I distance myself. Being a male doesn’t mean you can be an asshole. (And I’m talking from simple things like bringing the hose inside while on to extreme things like snapping girls’ bra straps at school or even to raping the girl that wouldn’t go out with you. Yes, I’ve experienced all of these with the excuse “Boys will be boys.”) 

My boy may have brought the hose in, or pulled a girl’s hair that he liked, but you bet your ass that I didn’t dismiss it with a “Boys will be boys” comment or mentality. He’s now one of the most respectful, kind teenage males that I’ve EVER met, including my own generation.

LacedUpBree: I’m not a boy mom.. i have 2 sons 1 daughter and one son otw.. but my sons are my children and they will be held to the same standards as my daughter..

DrLilyPaddy: My boyfriend is great and always has my back, but his mother - a "boy mom" - absolutely hates my guts for existing. I have been no contact with her for 2 years now. 🤷🏻‍♀️

scarlettskadi: Two boys one girl here.
I was so happy the day I met my older son’s now wife - she is just perfect for him and if he ever treats her any less than the gold she is, I’ll elbow her mother out of the way and deal with him myself!
They do not have a good fatherly example, but they were taught how to treat others and to be accountable.
I see their feet of clay as well as having an endless amount of love for them.

Dizzy-Froyo319: As the mother of a male child I hate this term "boy mom"   but with that bring said I grew up as a "Tom boy" a kind of masculine female I had 3 brothers growing up and as a girl with no friends in the neighborhood only way I was able to fit in n feel accepted I would do things to help my parents whether it be gardening, chopping splitting hauling wood, or wrenching on engines with my dad so I guess I tried to just let my son be a boy as much as he wants without trying to influence his decisions so much by pushing sports n what not although he does enjoy "mudding" on his 4 wheeler and dirt biking and as long as his grades are decent C's or better he can do whatever his little heart desires he has 3 sisters who aren't very girl girl well 1 sister is

blanking0nausername: I have 3 brothers and no sisters. 

The love and affected she would show my brothers, versus the coldness she would show me, was horrible in a way I can’t really express 

 Not sure links are allowed but SNL [does a great bit on this type of mom](https://youtu.be/OXq0rM_1VHk?si=EFQUnQnI14OSlGqf)

Resolution-Plastic: Terrible. I come from a family of four sisters and one brother, we always got treated the same – mayyybe a little favourable toward my brother, but he was also the youngest so it was kind of expected. When I started dating my now husband – WHOA. I had never experienced a mum looking at me as a villain for "taking her baby boy away." 

I suffered years of insults, personal attacks and snide remarks before she (AND THE REST OF THE WOMEN IN THE FAMILY, especially his nana) realised they were simply driving their "baby boy" further away. Thanks to them I have significant anxiety surrounding family events, as well as a complex about the way I look, how much money I make, my mental health... the list goes on. 

Currently in therapy trying to untangle the mess they made of my self worth. On a positive – I've been with my husband for ten years, married for two. Suck it, boy mum and co.

TheRelishTray: I heard a phrase a long time ago.....some women only have boys because the universe doesn't want them raising women. I only believed that a little after leaving my abusive ex whose "boy mom" mom acted like she understood my decision to leave him..... and then did a complete turn around and throws me under the bus to anyone who will listen.

meowpitbullmeow: I have one boy and one girl so half a boy mom? I say the word penis more than ever before.

hypatia_knows_best: They are usually desperate for granddaughters

micha1213: I’m a mom to boys and don’t really that about it in “boy mom” terms much at all. Only when their feet stink or I’m tripping over avengers do I think “this is what it’s like to be a boy mom”. Love these dudes

ParentTales: I only know one that calls herself that. Motherhood is 100% of her life. One kids a wuss and the others is a trouble maker. The trouble maker threw a shoe at my face, I told him off and the mom cuddled him. Trouble maker is always causing something and then gets coddled. So not great experience with “boy moms”

VelvetDreamers: I only know one ‘boy mum’ whose emotional incest is repugnant. He is essentially her teenage husband; they have date nights and she loathes his girlfriends.

kinkakinka: I have thankfully not encountered the stereotypical "BoY mOm" types in real life

Cornphused4BlightFly: Dated several guys from boy mom families - I was never good enough for their babies….  

I was modeling professionally, working full time paying my own bills and I owned my own home, and I was earning two degrees with a triple major and headed to law school.   

But I wasn’t good enough for their boy. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤯

Initial-View1177: Gives me major ick. As the mom of 3 girls, I have never once called myself a "girl mom". I'm just "mom"

TheNightWitch: I have sons, and meet a lot of ‘boy moms’ - who are a different group than ‘women who have sons.’ Boy moms perpetuate toxic masculinity like it’s their job, pushing masculinity stereotypes like they get paid to do it. They love teaching their sons that women exist to do their emotional labor. 

One of my sons played a sport in high school that attracts boy moms, and I spent a lot of time in the stands playing anthropologist. They swing wildly between competing for whose son is the grossest/messiest/most useless and whose son is the literal embodiment of perfection. Overall, they never talk about their sons like they are just regular people with ideas and dreams and emotions. It’s just toxic masculine stereotyping that keeps their sons in rigid little boxes.

MissingADong: My own mother. She kept going until she had a son (little does she know I identify as a man) she had 4 girls until she had a son. My dad didn’t care that he had all girls. 

My mum treats my brother like a king. He can do no wrong. While the rest of us had to work our asses off both in the house and at work to support the family, he was sitting there playing games, sleeping in, he wasn’t allowed to have a job until 22 years old. Now he struggles to even find a job. I low key just think he doesn’t apply for anything. He’s now 26 and games all day and night while my mum and dad are killing themselves to fund him. He slept in their bed until he was 13 years old. My dad tried everything he could to make him into a man. Mum stopped him because it meant that my brother would have to do things. I would often find my mum cuddling my brother in bed. 

I moved the hell out and saved myself. Every time my sisters or I bring up the subject of my failed brother to my mum, she yells at us saying he’s trying for a job and that we aren’t to ‘break his head’ (a saying in Arabic) so that he won’t turn out to be a broken loser. 

Anyway. It’s been a weird life in that aspect. But yes, boy mum for sure.

rae_09: Seems to be their entire personality tbh.

katat25: I’m a social worker and have spent the majority of my career advocating for and providing therapy to victims and survivors of SA. Better believe we talk about consent, boundaries, safe sex, technology in our home!! I’m fiercely protective of him but I am fiercely protective of everyone I care about. I do worry about his sweet heart being broken someday but I’m not delusional enough to think my son can do no wrong. I mean…I have to wipe the toilet seat before sitting down. Kids are GROSS.

MoonGoddess8519: My experience with “boy moms” is there is some oedipus complex involved whether or not the mom is aware of it. 

If we want men to behave differently when they grow up and help out around with domestic chores and 50/50 work, start raising your boys differently. 

Also, this can go both ways with daughters and fathers.

Ok-Particular4877: Ooh this whole thread is giving me the ick....

rayray2k19: My husband's aunt has 3 boys and 1 girl. The girl is the youngest. She still calls herself a boy mom. She also posts family pics from when she just had the boys and calls it "my most precious season"

luvrg1rll: So bad holy shit i broke up w my ex cause he cheated on me and his mum messaged me asking me to meet him one last time to give HIM closure!!😭😭😭 she then said there are many forms of cheating and some ‘aren’t as bad as others and more forgivable’ I was like girl what, this was also after I told her that he showed up to my house, a 2 hour drive away from him, and waited in his car for hours until early morning to try and catch me!! Good lord I dodged a bullet😭

the_owl_syndicate: I have a student named "King". His mom freely admits that she named him that because "after 3 girls,  I finally had my king". 

It's extremely difficult to stay on her good side because the least bit of criticism or expectations (yes,  it's an expectation your kid be awake during school and do his work) puts her on the defensive. 

"I'm not going to make him do anything he doesnt want to" is something she has said to me more than once.

Good news for her,  she's gonna have her "king" live when her his entire life.

-FaithTrustPixieDust: Not good.

ferretsarerad: I avoid. The pick me vibes and making your child the cornerstone of your existence. Shits weird 

By comparison - and perhaps personal bias - I do find the "girl dads" vibe kinda cute, in particular when a cis male is not afraid to be vulnerable by being open to bending traditional roles. Example - my father would NEVER have let me paint his nails, do his makeup, etc. I love seeing millenial men embrace "feminine" play and creativity.

BONE_SAW_IS_READEEE: They’re incredibly misogynistic oddly enough. Love putting down other women and girls just to pump up their sons.

iamgina2020: Mine couldn’t do any wrong in the marriage, his mom both believed, and spread around any lies he told her. The only time she wouldn’t take his side was when it was in direct conflict with her, and would look bad on her.
They had a really dysfunctional relationship, so much toxic femininity seeped into the marriage, and I could do nothing to prevent it. I’m out of it now and haven’t spoken to either of them for a long time, life’s very peaceful now.

Ok_Commission9026: They let their sons do anything and instead of admitting they are lazy parents just say "🤷‍♀️ boys will be boys".

Proper_Raccoon7138: I’m struggling with this right now. Husband is the oldest son & a junior so the sun literally rose and fell on his shoulders. They never made him do anything around the house and said that as long as he was working (he only paid his car insurance) then he could stay there as long as he wanted. His sisters on the other hand were treated like dog shit and all of them ended up moving out way before 18. We’ve been together 4 years and have the same fight over and over about him helping around the house or even just simply listening when I talk. I’ve tried speaking with his parents about it but they just brush it off as funny or cute and make excuses for him. I’m done with my masters in 1.5 years so if things don’t change by then I’m divorcing him and moving out of state with my dog/cat.

soupallyear: Dated the son of one. It was HORRIBLE.

International-Owl165: I used too work with a lady who had all Boys. She babied them and disliked me so much. She was 40 and I'm in my 20s? 

She was horrible , a lot of workers didn't like her. She would always throw tantrums when things didn't go her way

pcweber111: I am married to a boy mom who is super harsh on her daughter. I have to mediate otherwise they’d tear each other apart. Her sons though? Sweet talkings to and always trying to keep them from fighting. We’ve had talks about it, with therapists, but she can’t stop. At this point our daughter, who will be 16 in two months, will bounce once she’s 18, and my wife has already said maybe it’s best for her. 

My wife has some serious anger towards her mother, but refuses to acknowledge it’s affecting her relationship with her daughter. She’s also incredibly headstrong and has issues acknowledging when she’s wrong. At this point I’ve just accepted it, and I make sure to be calm and rational with her and our daughter, and I try to provide as much positive love to her as I can. It’s super frustrating though.

Fish-taco-xtrasauce: Ugh exhausting. The feminine version of toxic masculinity.

Maddsbutneverangry12: My husband is the oldest of 4 boys. 
His mom literally did not give me anything I asked… like a towel after swimming or showering or like water or a spoon or whatever until he asked her. If I asked her, she didn’t know or understand (Spanish is first language but know English VERY well) but when he asked, he got it right away. My husband is a regular dude, smart, tall handsome…. Her other sons are slums.

Apprehensive_Algae24: I dated a boy mom and when I was 9 months pregnant he slept in the floor of his moms room because “she needed him”

>> Niccixo: Yup! Unbelievable isn’t it

chewycolours: Well… A lot. I fear they’re actually in love with their kids. It’s creepy sometimes

ThrowRARAw: My best friend's mum is a boy mum - her daughter/my bsf was always criticised meanwhile her son/bsf's brother was a god who could do no wrong. 

Also although my mum isn't a boy mum I guarantee she has the stereotypical boy mum attitude as any time any of my guy friends does the bare minimum, including FOLDING A TOWEL, she applauds them as though they saved 10 lives.

tarubea: I feel like it goes one of two ways. I have met the internalized misogyny type of boy moms but just thought I’d share a positive experience I’ve had with one. My ex of several years was one of six boys (and no daughters). Although she fiercely loved her boys, I found she was incredibly welcoming and charitable to their girlfriends and wives who joined the family because she finally got to experience a sort of mother-daughter relationship. She would invite us to events and try to get to know us as people outside of our relationship with her sons. So much so that even when my ex and I broke up, we had built enough of a relationship that she kept in touch and genuinely wanted the best for me. I know she’s done that with other exes of his brothers too when they were around for long enough. I think some might see it as overbearing but she really struck me as someone who didn’t let her “boy mom” experience stop her from valuing and nurturing the young women in her life.

musicalsigns: Just chilling in here and making a list of shit *not* to do with/for/about my two boys. Don't mind me. 🍿

EdelwoodEverly: I was raised in the Homeschool movement. Lots of "Boys Will Be Boys" stuff said about things that were not normal by any stretch of the imagination. During one incident, I had a kid shove me down and kick me, his mom said, "He likes you!"

The feeling isn't mutual ma'am and he's going to be force fed sand the minute you turn your back,

MutedOlive9065: They baby and do everything for them which leads them to be crippled mamas boys who expect their wives to do everything for them too. Terrible.

mhighz: The worst experience of my life

South_Opportunity_52: Didn’t last . One still loved with his mommy even though he owned a home he rented out . So glad I got rid of that one quickly

Kirbyateme: My bf is one of two boys and his mother is a wonderful, kind and compassionate lady. She loves her boys, but understands that they need to learn things for themselves, and gives them their own space. She doesn’t dote on them, and does not compete with other women/SO’s like I see in other comments. Shes a good listener, very empathic and gives great advice. And she does cool mom shiz like play video games and collect Godzilla stuff. How much better can it get? I feel very lucky to have her as my future mom-in-law

obesewhaleofficial: she blamed me for ‘turning my boyfriend trans’ even though he was an abusive schizophrenic and i tried convincing him to go to therapy instead of transitioning 
(i’m an ally, but he just wanted to be a different person bc he hated himself, not actually trans)

atlaslapis: My exes mom babied him to her hearts content. He didn’t work and as far as I know of still doesn’t work. I bought everything for him. When we broke up, I left her aware that there were more than 1,000s of nudes on his phone (he had a porn addiction). She then proceeded to call me a whore and a bad influence on her son. He’s in his 20s dating high schoolers.

b1ack1323: My mother sees my wife as competition, if she’s not my servant my mom says judgy shit to her.

Anyway we moved away, partly for jobs and partly because she would just show up at our house, get argumentative and throw a fit and leave.

When we moved she said “you are just going to have to accept that you will have to support her the rest of your life.” My wife had job hopped a few times so she was labeled as weak and couldn’t stick it out.  She makes $100k a year while my mom never made over $30k in her life.  I don’t know how she thinks I am carrying her…

SensitiveWerewolf951: It’s glaringly obvious they value boys more than girls due to the misogyny engrained in them as a result of the patriarchy.

oreospluscoffee: I’m a girl and boy mom: boy is the baby. I try really hard to not let his sisters do everything for him. He’s 4 this year so instilling a lot of “you made this mess, clean it up. Clothes also don’t belong on the floor.” Etc etc. I do gush over him cause he’s my baby but I’m well aware I’ll be kissing the ground his significant other walks on and taking her side no matter what so we have a good relationship and I get to see him and possible grandchildren more.

>> scarlettskadi: It’s very special to see them so in love with their perfect woman.
Enjoy your little one while he’s small. 😊

>> oreospluscoffee: Really?! I have this vision especially with my girls that no one is going to be good enough for them 😂 I’ll have to choke that down

>> scarlettskadi: Haha yes I understand that- definitely give people a chance though.
They’re no doubt nervous about meeting Mum. 😆

Objective_Water_4962: I’ve had two experiences. My ex’s mum hated me! And I had no clue why, he was her only child and son so I understand they can be protective like any parent would be. But no matter what I did, she hated me. I’m now married and my mother in law has two sons and two daughters, I get on with her like a house on fire and she’s great to me, it just depends.

Mightbedumbidk: I don’t have one, because of all the stories I’ve heard from other ppl I avoid them.

shackofcards: I'm a boy mom. I have a three year old boy. He's wonderful, but I do my best to be his mom and not his friend. He needs to learn boundaries, respect, consent, and all the basic domestic skills. Just like a girl would in my house. I want to empower him to embody positive masculinity, if that's what he wants. If he's LGBTQ, I want to support him and validate his identity. I just want to raise a happy, respectful, well-adjusted adult that other people enjoy knowing and feel safe around. Man or woman, the goal is the same.

nerdyhoe: My mom is a boy mom and sheesh while I do love my mother she fits the stereotype somewhat. She's really made a lot of excuses for them over the years, invested all her time in their sports/lives, and just overall makes some comments about women to them that I think have contributed to them not treating the women in their lives well. Don't get me wrong, no one's ultimately responsible for it other than them, but the way she talked about women with them when I was growing up, just grossed me out. I'm a sister to three brothers btw!

vicariousgluten: The one I knew would in the same breath talk about how feminist she was but also that she was glad she was a boy mum because boys were so much less complicated.

yoserena_: I don’t know if this counts but my ex had 4 brothers and one sister (she was the baby). My ex’s mother had this larger than life personality, at times she could be so crass to the other girlfriends luckily I did not spend much time around her so she never got the opportunity to roast me. 

On many occasions I’ve heard her make fun of her eldest son’s girlfriend. They’ve been together for 10 years with two kids and unmarried, she would always say things to provoke her as if the lack of marriage wasn’t a reflection of her son and his up bringing.

She would say the nastiest things to her daughter, made fun of her weight and her skin color. Even though her daughter is the same complexion as her self.

Anyway, the most disturbing thing was the relationship she had with my boyfriend. She would kiss him on his mouth, he would call her sexy and tap her on the bum. It was weird man.

SunflowerFreckles: The ones I've met haven't been very good. Bossy insistent queen of the crops :( 

And with my brother's my mom treated my like garbage because I was competition, same with my MIL. She's a boy mom and I am scum that she always tries to turn everyone off from me so she can stay the only female spotlight because she's too insecure to have other females around now. 


I'm sure they're not all that way though. The world is full of sweethearts!

Iwantbubbles: UGH

lvasnow: It's different as a teacher, I know, but the relationship I have with my middle school boy students is different than the girls.
With the girls, I try to be warm but fun. I try very much to emphasize talking out feelings/needs and I try to celebrate them and push them to try things a lot - no apologizing for existing! When it's a good relationship, it often feels like there's a shorthand we have. That being said, our fights are often emotional, complex and extremely taxing. 

With the boys, it's either amazing or horrific. If we get on, I find it's usually a very straightforward, warm relationship that isn't always about "deep" stuff, and the love is more unspoken. Its often very joyous. I make a huge deal about boundaries and responsibility. I try to talk to them a lot about being accountable, and say I always respect them more when they own up to things. I do that with the girls, too, but with the boys I go out of my way to do it. I'll be damned if I help raise a bunch of dudes who aren't able to accept the word "no" and unable to say "I was wrong." 

Tl; dr: When it's a positive relationship, with girls often talk about the "deep stuff." 
With the boys, I often remember why life is good.

SweetTattedBaby: My mom is a “ boy mom “ to my brother… I’m the first born and a girl… so yeah. Fill in the blanks!

Brilliant_Joke7774: The creepiest shit ever. As a woman, I know I and the daughter of a boy mom. And my husband has a sister but he’s def the child of a boy mom. My grandma has 4 boys, 1 girl, she’s a boy mom. 
All these “boy moms” I listed here were in emotional incest relationships with their sons. They both neglected their own daughters and created a rivalry with their son’s spouses. They wanted full control over their sons and they did any and everything to get it including making up fake freak accidents to get their sons to come rush to their rescue. 

It sucks bc these moms of boys can be like this even now. So when normal moms who have sons are out and about tryna love their best life, they’re automatically categorized as one of the crazy boy moms simply bc they have (a) son/s.

PLEASE NOTE: I’m clearly not saying this applies to all moms with sons, just the majority of the crazies that I’ve met and I’m even related to

Due-Locksmith-9039: Apparently it’s nothing positive, it looks like all of the comments on being taken down!

RosaHosa: Horrible. Dated one that was the only boy out of 4 children AND he was the youngest. His sisters and mom treated me like shit.

He was very useless for house chores and he didn’t know how to laundry. His parents creepily worshipped him and talked bad about his sisters too.

lollypolish: I’m a boy Mum and really appreciate the extra female energy if he has a girlfriend and treat them as friends and equals. Really can’t understand any other attitude.

Ash9260: Moms with sons, not bad ladies normal sometimes exhausted. Boy moms nasty women

Sp1cy_Chicken_Tender: My experience with boy moms is that they are attempting to make the husband they want out of the son they have.

igoof147: My mother is a boy mom. After my younger brother got his first girlfriend she hated her. And once said something like: I don't know why I feel this way. I never felt like this when you were dating. I feel like she is trying to take something from me. I definitely said something about that not being normal. She got mad about it and still hates any girl that gives him attention.

itso-complicated: she often offends other women without realizing it, but i don’t blame her cause she lives in a house with 4 men

virgorisingb: somehow every man that i’ve ever dated (seriously) has been a child of a single mother, and they were all boy moms in the worst way. Emotional and financial dependency, horrible stabs at my cute outfits… some things are more bearable than others.

Jess1012xxx: Annoying af. Sadly my sister is a boy mom. They are her sun and moon. They are her life, they do no wrong.

CalligrapherSlight44: lmao i was with my ex for 2 years on and off. his mom like never looked me in the eye, always got my name wrong seemingly intentionally, barely spoke to  me, and blocked my number when i told her the abuse her son caused. such a weird lady. yes he’s her only
child and boy

bluewood30: My MIL is a boy mom and she is fabulous in many ways.  She loves and admires her boys and they have a super healthy caring relationship towards her.   She is not under the impression that they do no wrong and often I find her encouraging my husband to do sweet things.  Heck, she taught him that wives deserve jewelry on a regular basis and for that, I love her!  Overall, her goal was clearly to raise MEN and not a back up husband for herself.

I do notice that she has taken to her granddaughters quite a lot though.  I do think maybe it’s her way of experiencing that part.  She spends a little more time with them and definitely spoils them much more.

PMmeDeepThoughts: I'm a mother of boys and girls and I would never call myself a "boy mom" bc it just has become this weird AF thing where they act like they're somehow better. But tbh this shit has been around forever it just used to be called "Mama's boy" and tbh every guy I have ever dated including my husband has been extremely spoiled by his mom. I refuse to be weird like that when they're my age and will make a huge effort to be cool with my son and daughter in laws. My MIL and FIL both still make excuses for my husband for any tiny thing so that nothing he does is ever wrong. It's so annoying.

Ccatmom_10: Woof I just had my first child, a boy. I hope no one ever is able to say these things about me 😅

AsterismRaptor: The worst. My ex husband was from a boy mom, she did everything for the two boys and then wondered why they were so lazy as adults.

coccopuffs606: Never again. 

One of my exes was the son of a boy mom and she was insufferable, along with the psychological damage she inflicted on him. She constantly guilt-tripped him, nagged about his career, belittled his life choices (including me), and basically did not want him to ever be completely independent from her.

Baboo1118: My high school boyfriend was an only child and his mom was so jealous when I came into the picture. She would call him and yell at him for hanging out with me instead of her, she was a nurse on night shift and would kick me out of his bed when she’d get home because she wanted to sleep in it, she complained about me showing her the dress I wanted to wear to ring dance with him, etc. It was emotional incest and I am so happy to be away from that family.

>> Baboo1118: Also my husband’s stepmom is a boy mom and has said several times “have a daughter, have a friend for life. Have a son and lose him to his wife” 😅 I’m the only girl and have two brothers. My mom definitely favors them and constantly takes digs at me.

mudderofdogs: They raise selfish pricks. Oh my boy!  He’s perfect

-AngelinDisguise_:  Not a good one, what I’m scared the most he maybe not fight for you if you got a misunderstanding with his mom or one of his family

between3n20chrcters:  RUN TF AWAY. if you date a boy who has a “boy mom” you’re basically in competition with her. and sometime you won’t win. and he will choose her side (when he really shouldn’t.)

yomamma890: Many are SEXIST. I cannot stress this enough. Of all ages. 

There are women with boy babies that are fine and normal but ones who consider it special prize... problematic at all times.

chiquitabonitas: Dated a mama’s boy for 8 years. Although I did find it sweet how caring and loving he was towards his mom, there were always the cringe aspects when would say “it’s my mom first then you.” 

Or when we were at the end of our relationship cause he was physically and mentally abusive. I went to her crying to tell her that he put hands on me.. her response was “oh my goodness! Yes he has such a bad temper sometimes.” Like what? 
It was over after that.

churbb: Yesterday I got one of the “I loved him first” instagram reels sent to me on instagram 🫡

BarbarianFoxQueen: A Boy Mom and her son are blackmailing my brother into free rent, internet, and food. The son is “claiming” my brother SA’d him (boy is 18) and that he’ll go to the police if my brother doesn’t comply. 

Her son is an incel who won’t get a job, and just wants to spend his entire existence online in his room. Mom is his ‘friend’ and doesn’t want to make him hate her.

Obvious-Dinner-5695: I've had more than one boy mom try to stop me or blame me for calling the police when her precious son beat me. I don't trust them.

dippedbagel2811: Lol, naur, naur, aur naur

Blue_nicole114: We r still together but his mother makes me feel like im in a literal movie 
I met her 2+ years into our relationship she was nice at first but barely spoke to me as if I wasn’t in the room. What first made me uncomfortable was that she would call him handsome and tell him his eyes r gorgeous OVER AND OVER LIKE ONCE is okay by me but every 10 minutes is so annoying and then she was always super touchy play fighting and fixing his hair or something 

This is where it started making me really uncomfortable 
We were laying in the bed watching a movie together while staying with her for the week she came in to see what we were up to and plopped herself in the middle of us and put HER LEG ON HIM UK HOW COUPLES DO ?! Like WHAT and in other instances we’d be walking into a place and if I was holding his hand she’d yell for him to hold her hand and basically pull him away from me then we went to the pride parade and she kept saying how all of those times she asked him to go he never wanted to but he was going with me it just felt like we were always in competition 
THIS IS WHERE I LITERALLY KNEW THAT I WASNT IMAGINING SHIT 
we were talking to her and my bf was hungover from the night b4 so he had left to throw up while he was gone she proceeded to tell me ‘I don’t like you I think my son should be with other girls’ and that she knew that I proposed got things handed to me growing up (I was an abused runaway btw which she didn’t know bc we had only met twice atp) and so much other shit and as soon as her son came back in the room she was peaches and cream 
Now my bf doesn’t fully believe me and I did comfront the issue bout her being all over him to which she just cried and made it seem like I’m the bad guy we discuss it he’s okay wit me now speaking to her (there is more that happened that lead me to that) honestly if we didn’t live in another state I think this would’ve been a bigger relationship issue but I’m okay with it atp

Ok_Captain5768: OH MY GOD OKAY. 
So, I was a teen atp, and I went to musical theatre. I had a massive crush on this guy. At first I absolutely hated his guts, he was so annoying and his mere presence annoyed me. Until I started to like him ofc. So, we got talking, and eventually got together. It was very early on. He was a classic boy, but mostly respectful. He’d ask me to send him photos of myself over Instagram, because his mum would take his phone ( we must’ve been 14-15). I wasn’t comfortable sending photos, so everytime he asked I turned him down. Until one day, I thought it would be funny to agree to him, and send him a pic of a naked man with his ass out. I did say in a following text after his response “ you do realise that’s not me”, we laughed it off. 
Then, he tells me that his mum had been through his phone, and didn’t want me to be with him anymore, so she made him break up with me. Not only this, when I went to musical theatre, I got pulled out of rehearsal by the head tech, the chairman and one of the other staff. They showed me screenshots of our chats, and basically said that their hands were tied, because the texts were “incriminating” ( which I still fully believe to this day, was not. The only slightly incriminating thing was that photo, hidden by a 1time timer thing.) they basically said that I could either go quietly, or they would have to kick both my mum ( who also worked with the company and I ) out. I was absolutely devastated.  I felt so much anger, resentment. He did apologise to me, but nah, that’s messed up. 
Musical theatre was one of the only things keeping me going in that period of my life, I enjoyed it so much. After that year, once he’d left, they said I could come back, and I did, but it wasn’t the same, they always had that look of disappointment in their eyes. It hurt so much knowing that I genuinely was innocent, I said to them, if anything, he should get in trouble for trying to force me to send pictures of myself, and they just said his mum is dealing with that. I’d like to add, his family are rich, he went to this private school right next to mine. 
Anyway, rant over.

nyanvi: Mixed bag.

So I think it's just a matter of a generally shitty personality that just happens to have a son(s).

They would have been just as insufferable regardless of what gender child they would have had...

schofield789: I have never heard of the term 'boy mums' but it makes total sense now!

lemsmi: My mother in law had 4 boys. She's the sweetest lady to her boys and their spouses (including me).  My mom is a 'girl mom' and is not nice to anyone lol.

derpsterchic: Half related but his mom needed boundaries when we first started living together and she blamed me for the boundaries (were married now, she’s like 70% better now) and his brother recently got married and I told his now wife good luck (they moved in together after marriage) and she’s like “oh it’ll be different” 

lol no it’s not different. Mom is now blaming brother’s wife for boundary setting. 

In a vacuum his mom could be a lot worse, she’s just a lot sometimes.

Repulsive-Fuel-3012: Terrible ppl 😭😭

Long_Yam_4866: Usually males with overbearing moms never mature into men due to their moms extreme coddling, enabling, and controlling behavior. I was with a boy for 5 years whose mom I loved individually but she was not letting him grow up. She only had two boys so this is an EXTREME boy mom. To her, he could never do wrong, she was constantly paying for everything for him. Cars, houses, college, anything he wanted but would deny that she was doing it. When I wanted to talk about marriage at year 5 and really know what was going on financially so I knew what I was getting myself into she told me “it’s really none of your business” and “you’ve been in such a mood lately” gaslighting the absolute fuck out of me. This boy was a master manipulator and I can’t help but think his mom played a big role in that personality trait. AVOID BOY MOMS AT ALL COSTS

rohlovely: Dated the firstborn son of a “boy mom” a few years back. He had a complicated birth and was premature, so even though he was the oldest he was “her baby”. He was also the only one with straight blond hair, the rest(3 other boys) had dark ringlets. 

He had been sheltered his whole life and was so scared of basic things because his mom had told him they would have life-threatening consequences (travel, sex, drugs/alcohol) and he had a very unhealthy relationship with the world as a whole. Constantly nervous and struggled to communicate when something bothered him even a little bit. NEVER had experimented with anything outside of occasionally having a spiked seltzer, but wanted to and expressed that he wanted my help becoming more confident. 

He was such a sweet guy, genuinely I loved him a lot, but he lacked spine so much that he told his parents the first time we smoked weed together and his mom told him to break up with me because I was “putting him on my dark path” and “casting a shadow over their family.” 

She loved me previously and it was only after he told her we had smoked that she decided I was actually the devil. God. I am so glad I never have to talk to that woman again.

Apprehensive-Shoe967: I’m a boy mom, but I’m not a *boy mom*

SpaceGuy1968: I knew she was not normal

invisibleextension: I learned they will always choose their son. My ex was on a dating app after 2  years together and living together. I was over it and left him. Her thoughts? “She didn’t TRY to work it out?” I never spoke to him or his family again.

Ok-Scientist-7652: My other half is the youngest of three boys. I can honestly say that I love his mum. She's great. I love spending time with her. Feel very lucky to have her in my life.

None: I'm a boy mom and I only just found out that apparently that means you're emotionally incestuous toward your kids and that's weird. I'm well aware it happens but if we could just not had insane meaning to innocent words that'd be super appreciated. I'm a boy mom because I have 3 boys that do a lot of "typical" boy shit. It's all buttcheeks and hot chips over here. 

Anyway, my experience with a toxic mother in law: she hated me even though I was always nice to her. She was obsessed with my son, though.  She would constantly talk about how he looked just like her son (not his father and no he doesn't) and called him her grandson the first day she met him. Thought it was sweet at first, then we found out that she had her friend at his daycare calling her with any issues they had or if he was sick, instead of me. She broke into our house while we were on vacation and stole a bunch of my son's clothes, toys, and his baby quilt my grandmother had made. She replaced his clothes with goodwill clothes. Her husband at the time said it was because she wanted to have nicer things for him than we did, so he preferred being with her. I got some of the stuff back, but never the quilt. When I was pregnant with her first blood grandchild, I found out that she had wanted to throw a baby shower just after my grandmother had booked a venue. So I called and told her that we had a place but nothing else was planned so I'd love for her to take over planning if she wanted. I don't have a mom, so no one was going to fight her for it. She accepted and seemed happy, then called her son pissed that I had booked somewhere and demanded she get to throw a baby shower for just him that I wasn't invited to! 😂 When he said no she told him he needed to take his balls back and put his foot down. They haven't spoken since and she's never met her 8 yr old grandchild. She just got busted in South Carolina a year or so ago for scamming the whole community and some charities by claiming to have a 5013c and taking donations for lots of causes but never giving it to who it was intended. Not sure if it was emotional incest or she's just fuckin crazy, but it was a whirlwind and her son ended up being a lot like her in different ways.

Sea-Welcome9497: She wants him lol

None: My step mom was also obsessive and weird with my brother. She broke up every "relationship" he had when he was younger and tried really hard as he got older. Always butting her nose in and inserting her opinions. She only ever liked one of his girlfriends because of daughter. That girl got pregnant on purpose, then cheated, then decided she didn't want my brother or the new baby anymore. She tried to abort but it was too late, my brother said he wanted her and she agreed, then tried to put her up for adoption behind his back twice. My niece is 4 now and my step mom still has a relationship with that ex, but treated my brother's wife like shit. Would bring up the ex right in front of her and talk about how she missed her and had pictures of her hanging up but cropped his wife out of pictures then hung them up on her walls. Just nuts.

eerieqloss: I heard someone once say the "I'm one of the boys"/"I'm not like the other girls" grow up into boy moms
And I can't help but agree

housebb13: I love my bf’s mom, a mom of 2 sons! Maybe she’s an anomaly but she’s been nothing but wonderful to me since I’ve been dating her son over the last 6 years. She’s a great mom, non-judgmental, respectful of space/boundaries and treats me and her other son’s gf like family. I have so much to look up to and learn from her for when I become a mom.

evaj95: My grandma is a big boy mom and a bigger boy grandma. 

Her daughter/my mom is the only girl with 2 younger brothers and she was told things like "boys don't have to make their beds" and "boys are easier to raise" growing up. 

My grandmother has 6 grandkids. 30F, 29F (me), 25M, 10F, 2M, and 8monthsM. As you can probably tell by our ages, for a while it was just the oldest 3 cousins. My grandma loves us all but it's definitely not equal. She praises 25M cousin in a much different way than she praises me and his sister (30F). 

I was graduating college at the same time as he was graduating from high school. I was going through a tough finals week trying to get all of my last assignments done and tie up any loose ends before graduation and she was texting me about how awesome he was...

After his graduation, we were over at her house (I think we were celebrating Father's Day?) and she said in front of me "25M is so amazing..." with a dreamy look on her face. My aunt was like "I think all the kids are pretty amazing!" It felt so crushing. It felt like no matter what my female cousins and I do, it will never compare to the baseline, bare minimum achievements of our male cousins...

VeryPoliteYak: My ex’s mom… lovely lady, adored her sons’ girlfriends (me included) but did far, far too much for them. I’m talking never allowed them to learn how to cook or enter the kitchen (“that’s my job”), would personally pay my ex’s older brother’s rent and drive to his house to clean it, collect laundry, do said laundry, and deliver it back again… just insane. 

Like yes, she was very loving which was very nice for me to experience (my own mom was not super loving/doting) but she effectively kept her two sons incapable. My ex tried to break through that a bit but it was difficult.

sunsetrise013: I used to nanny for a boy mom and I was chosen as her impromptu therapist. She would talk about all of her problems with her husband and I was the only other female around who she felt comfortable enough to vent to.

Other than that, she was pretty cool. She didn’t care that we played in the rain and the mud, and she planted a whole orchard and vegetable garden in the front and back of their suburban house. They had chickens and dogs who were obviously bathed less than twice per year. She just enjoyed life. She worked and spent time with her sons and dogs.

Now, she’s divorced and is happier than I’ve ever seen her with an even happier little boy.

Afrolover25: Most moms love me but i only had 1 experience with a crazy one. She threatened me two times to which he pulled her aside and told her to stop. Each threat was in a weird baby voice to camouflage the actual threat. He ended up moving far as possible from her at the end

Zealousideal_Bus7335: didn't realise this was a thing, thought it was just patriarchy. My parents were pretty awful 5 daughters 2 boys. Guess who the sun shone out of and who gad to look after them. its really sad, I have 2 boys and a beautiful little girl hoping to do  better job of making them feel loved but self sufficient. Don't get taken for a ride and don't take anyone for a ride. 

why are women so quick to be so hard on other women be it mothers, sisters, daughters.... very rarely have I heard a mam hate on another man so quickly.

sending you all love from this "boy mum"

12dancingbiches: The majority of my asian classmates were raised by boy moms because its a thing to favor sons in asian culture. There was a girl who was raised by a boy mom that bullied me and she stopped when I told her that her mom was right for not loving her and only loving her brother. 

I promise i was 8 and did not understand how awful that really was.

Kyauphie: They are not my favorite humans. Those that protect their obviously dangerous sons are...dangerous.

ItsSUCHaLongStory: My husband’s mother wouldn’t know the term “boy mom”, but she sure is one. She’s pissed at me and her other son’s wives for stealing her retirement plan and validation. She loves to talk shit about us, and she adores kids….until they can walk and talk. Or aren’t genetically related to her. 

She raised a daughter who is *exactly* like her, and loves to run her down and talk shit about her, too. They’re both horrible people, and my husband’s brothers are various levels of dysfunctional due to her. I have zero idea how my husband came out so normal.

xsapphireblue: I think a friend of mine would be a boy mom. She’s thinking about having kids but only wants boys not girls because “girls can get pregnant”. Like guys could still get people pregnant too

Bruh_columbine: My husbands mom is a BoyMom ™️ she’s horrific. On top of that she’s also a drug addict and a paranoid schizophrenic. It’s taken ten years for my husband to see through her bullshit. Today he actually blocked her 🎉

Apprehensive_Piece80: I’ve never had the same issues as other people did. My bf mom had 4 kids total. Three boys, and her final being a girl. Their second oldest son had my bf very young, and couldn’t take care of him, so his grandparents adopted him. Now making them his parents and not grandparents. Although she ended up having a girl, she never changed when she had her. She babies my bf like no other. Cooks for him, cleans his clothes, cleans his room, and makes his bed. But she loves me. I guess after years of not having another girl around since her daughter moved out, she was super excited when i came around and stayed. She buys me clothes, asks for my opinion on stuff she buys. She’s really the sweetest woman ever. She has her moments where i can tell she’s a boy mom at heart, but she also never planned on having that many kids, but she obviously really wanted a girl. She understands when my bf does something wrong and makes sure he understands that he’s in the wrong. She’s the same way with her other sons as well.

Confident_Victory_27: Was married to an only child who had the classic ‘boy mom’. He used to hit me frequently so out of frustration I went to his mother with the complaint (my family disowned me for marrying him). She said, ‘don’t worry, the second you give him a child he will stop hitting you. So just hang in there until you can do that’. 

I left him shortly after :):):)

SnooChocolates3863: I dated the son of a “boy mom” for a bit over 6 years.
Horrible. I could write a novel, but the most memorable instances included:
Him sending her ALL of the money from his paychecks (the small bit of time he actually held a job) because they lived together and both managed money poorly, he would go broke sending her money for cigarettes and his other brother who lived in another state but would return to their house to fuel his drug addiction. In turn, I was expected to front EVERYTHING and fights arose when I was asked to loan money to her and diplomatically said I was unable to do so, because literally paying for everything. The few times I did loan her money she insisted she pay me back, but never did and was livid I asked about it.
She would have a tantrum if we had the audacity to go out to any restaurant and NOT ask her if she wanted something or wanted to go. This didn’t happen once in a while, not special occasions, every fucking time. Anniversaries and birthdays included.
We couldn’t have sex because he had to take care of the housework for her and vacuum her room and do her laundry, among other things.
He refused to get a car because she would drive him everywhere. I stopped carting him around when it became obvious he expected me to cancel plans, change work schedules, and bend over backwards to be his Uber and avoid a fight.
When she would go out of town on vacations, he would sleep in her bed and try to convince me it would be “fun”
He got upset one time when I didn’t want to have a “cuddle puddle” with him and her while watching a movie- in HER bed. I’ll share blankets on the couch all day, but I draw the line when it goes to that level.
She witnessed the absolute screaming matches toward the end, the ones he would start at 3am waking me out of a dead sleep because he wanted to argue then and there (I caught him being unfaithful, and in turn he created a “rule” neither of us were to the social media site in question- I didn’t follow it, because I wasn’t the one who was being shady- Told him as much and he despised me for it) She witnessed him screaming horrible shit at me, slamming doors and throwing shit, and of course, her baby boy did no wrong.

Writing all that down and reading it back, no idea why I stayed and dealt with that for so long. But god, I’m so glad that’s a chapter in the past. He hated when I would tell him I’m dating him, not him and his mom. 
Happy to say I’ve been free of that shit for a while, and with an absolutely amazing human for about 8 months. No family is perfect, but at least they’re not toxic and enmeshed, there’s no toxic money draining or ick factor, and there’s respect for our relationship.

Key_Stick_3002: My wife and I have three boys (8, 11, 21) so I'm reading all of this to see if she's got any of the toxic traits.

thanarealnobody: They are immune to the filth their sons choose to live in. 

If my mom saw me living in such disgusting conditions, she’d either stage an intervention or yell at me to get the fuck up and do my laundry. 

Boy moms will be like “oh my sweet Daniel, he’s such a klutz with cleaning. Let me do it for you, sweetheart. “

Bluefishm9: I'm the mother of a little boy, and this is the first time I'm even hearing this term 🤣

d3gu: My experience is that they think it's something that makes them quirky & unique, and are all 'I just wouldn't know how to raise a girl!!!'. I legitimately had that conversation with someone, and I felt like saying 'well, did you know how to raise boys? Or did you just work it out? No boy is the same after all'. I wonder if the whole 'making boymom my personality' enthusiasm is a bit of overcompensation because they'd also like a daughter.

Also, from a purely stubborn POV - only the father can determine the sex of a child. The mother has XX chromosomes and can only give an X. Men have XY and whichever they give (X or y) determines the sex. So what you really get is boydads.

Professional_Lime171: As a "boy mom" I'm not sure about the label because everyone seems to dislike it. But my son (2.5) is extremely energetic, rambunctious and interested in very traditionally boy interests all on his own. I myself am pretty disinterested in any "male" stuff, so I was trying to keep him well rounded with dolls and such but he just LOVES vehicles, sports and tools lol. I think the term came about from women like me possibly who maybe are more gentle and enjoy traditionally feminine interests but have had to acclimate the world of little boys. At least if that's the case, I can understand the struggle.

-ElderMillenial-: To me it's weird to define yourself by the gender of your children.

p00psicle151590: Eh. Not my favorite.

MiaMae: Wait.. wtf is this even? I consider myself a "boy mom" and I'm super chill. 

I coach lacrosse. 
I wrestle with my boys. 
I ride dirt bikes with them.
I encourage adventure. 
I camp and hike with them.
We ride jetskis together.
I'm comfortable with (safe) roughhousing.  
My car is full of sports stuff.
My laundry is always full of stinky socks.
No amount of food is ever enough.
My boys have mohawks.
We're sneaker-heads.
All outtings end covered in dirt/food/blood

Being a "boy mom" is not a bad thing, but it is notably different than moms with both genders or girls.

Y'all are describing "mama's boys" and those moms suck. They aren't my people. They raise entitled, incapable assclowns.

Maybe we shouldn't conflate the two concepts? 
I'm a "boy mom" but I'm fun as fuck and always down to clown 😁 My kids are fucking awesome because I'm raising responsible, confident, well-mannered, capable boys that will (hopefully) make loyal friends, respectful sons, and open/honest/reliable partners.

Just hope you're all raising your kids the same, so my sons are in good company 🥰

>> JamaicanXanax: A lot of people misunderstood my question. It's not about being the mom of a boy. It's about the toxic #boymom thing that's gaining more and more traction. Search for that hashtag on any social media platform and you'll understand what I'm asking about :D

MommyNeedsCoffee617: I haven't met a single one in my day to day life. At school and at sports we're all just regular moms. I think most "boy moms" are putting on a show for social media to be honest.

[reddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) | [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

rednecksnextdoor: I am a mother of two boys and have not had a negative interaction with anyone else who also just has sons. Most mothers (in general) that I meet are really down to earth.

TBH, I'd rather be labeled a "boy mom" than be the woman with daughters who she's in competition with. Would have loved to have a daughter, btw.

my_metrocard: I’m a boy mom and have lots of boy mom friends. We’re just like girl moms, but are accustomed to being  accidentally hit/kicked, and can dodge random projectiles.

rasqash: I have a son and a daughter and I try to treat them equally but there’s no denying the relationship is different between my son and my daughter. Even in just how they relate to me. My son is very much a mummy’s boy and happily admits it but it doesn’t mean he doesn’t get held accountable for his actions, even at 6.

It does mean I hear the word penis more often than not and I have to say “put your pants on, stop playing with yourself” more times than I care to recount.
It also means I constantly worry about how do I raise this boy to respect the word no, actually be independent and not rely on women to do everything for him, because at 6 I’m even seeing flashes of it when I ask  both kids for help cleaning up, putting things away etc him mucking around and letting his sister do the bulk of the work. 

I don’t understand the boy mum Tag tho, what does it mean? is it like the being the mum from Malcolm in the middle ? Internalised misogyny makes sense.

5tacyMarie: They love their boys a little (exaggeration) too much

CutePandaMiranda: All of the boy moms I know annoyingly make being a #boymom their entire identity and their one and only hobby. They live and breathe #boymom and apparently have no time for anything else, including their husbands and hobbies. As a woman who’s childfree, it’s pretty damn funny to see.

Insatiable_Cake: My experience as a “boy mom” is that I actively work against falling into the “boy mom” stereotype as it makes me deeply uncomfortable.

Baku_Bich420: I'm a boy mom and don't understand how some women get so creepy with their sons. My MIL is one as well and is toxic af. She's obsessed with them and their sexual organs/ sex life, gets pissed off if they so much as part attention to the opposite gender and not her, and rages if they think for themselves.

msphelps77: I have three boys. I am highly protective over them like a father is with his daughters. They are my boys and I do try and raise them to be good because I realize I am raising someone’s future husband. I love them a lot and want them to be strong independent men. I just don’t want any girl treating them like crap one day.

>> Professional_Lime171: Yes same here. I want my son to be responsible and accountable but I definitely don't want him to be with a woman who doesn't appreciate him or criticizes him relentlessly. I am a feminist but I fear some women are starting to hate men.

nevertruly: I don't know what that means beyond someone being a mom to a boy child, but I haven't noticed anything significantly different between them and moms of any other genders of children. I'm not a parent, so all of the children/parenting stuff is pretty unrelated to how I know the person.
